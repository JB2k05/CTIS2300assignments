    <h1>Star of the show</h1>
    <p>I will be reviewing one of the shows from <strong>Sza SOS tour</strong> in <emScotiabank Arena on February 25th 2023.</em></emScotiabank> Before I begin I personally think this show was definitely worth the time, money, and trouble to go to. I think the concert has an amazing concept considering the fact that the album cover is her over the ocean sitting on a plank/diving board. Which is fitting due to the fact Sza is doing that at the beginning of the concert singing a song that was kinda released but it didnt make it to the album nor get released on any streaming platforms other than YouTube the title of the song is <strong>PSA</strong>
<h2> Queen Performace </h2>
    <p>After the song is over there is a screen that covers her and a silhouette of Sza jumping into the water. As you see her at the center of the stage you can hear the crowd roaring and cheering for her. The LEDs on stage are playing a background of what looks like a dock kind of. She has great stage presence as sheâ€™s dancing and not just standing like a broomstick. Like many concerts she has drums, piano and a guitar which the guitar player plays on stage with Sza. Also while she sings with the guitar player they are on a boat. How cool is that? Sza also has a boat that is in the air which I thought was absolutely amazing especially when she pulled because it wasnt something many of us were expecting.</p>
    <h3>Like a boss</h3>
   <p> Another thing that many of us couldve not expected is Sza doing a split on the boat also. There were no type of technique difficulties that happened in the show that Im aware of. One thing that I loved about it may not be in this performance but in some of her over performances in her tour she always checks on everyone to make sure they are okay in the middle of her songs. The show was filled with so much excitement and love that I wish I was able to go too. Most of her songs were r&b, soul,grunge rock,hip hop, & pop which she tried to fit with a specific setting of every song. She did a cover sample of <strong>Bag Lady by Erykah Badu</strong>  and a little sample cover of <strong>I Dont Wanna Be by Aaliyah</strong>. In the end I really enjoyed the show. I am a very big fan of Sza so Im kind of jealous of the fact I didnt get to go. However, I think SOS truly helped reach her to new heights and prove that she can hang with the best of them. </p>
